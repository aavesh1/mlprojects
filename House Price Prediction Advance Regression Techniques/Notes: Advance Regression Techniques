Notes: Advance Regression Techniques

Examine your data
Clean Your Data
Test Your assumptions

In order to have some discipline in our analysis, we can create an Excel spreadsheet with the following columns:

Variable - Variable name.
Type - Identification of the variables' type. There are two possible values for this field: 'numerical' or 'categorical'. By 'numerical' we mean variables for which the values are numbers, and by 'categorical' we mean variables for which the values are categories.
Segment - Identification of the variables' segment. We can define three possible segments: building, space or location. When we say 'building', we mean a variable that relates to the physical characteristics of the building (e.g. 'OverallQual'). When we say 'space', we mean a variable that reports space properties of the house (e.g. 'TotalBsmtSF'). Finally, when we say a 'location', we mean a variable that gives information about the place where the house is located (e.g. 'Neighborhood').
Expectation - Our expectation about the variable influence in 'SalePrice'. We can use a categorical scale with 'High', 'Medium' and 'Low' as possible values.
Conclusion - Our conclusions about the importance of the variable, after we give a quick look at the data. We can keep with the same categorical scale as in 'Expectation'.
Comments - Any general comments that occured to us.

Skewness is a measure of asymmetry of a distribution.
· In a normal distribution, the mean divides the curve symmetrically into two equal parts at the median and the value of skewness is zero.
· When a distribution is asymmetrical the tail of the distribution is skewed to one side-to the right or to the left.
· When the value of the skewness is negative, the tail of the distribution is longer towards the left hand side of the curve.
· When the value of the skewness is positive, the tail of the distribution is longer towards the right hand side of the curve

Kurtosis is one of the two measures that quantify shape of a distribution. kutosis determine the volume of the outlier
· Kurtosis describes the peakedness of the distribution.
· If the distribution is tall and thin it is called a leptokurtic distribution(Kurtosis > 3). Values in a leptokurtic distribution are near the mean or at the extremes.
· A flat distribution where the values are moderately spread out (i.e., unlike leptokurtic) is called platykurtic(Kurtosis <3) distribution.
· A distribution whose shape is in between a leptokurtic distribution and a platykurtic distribution is called a mesokurtic(Kurtosis=3) distribution. A mesokurtic distribution looks more close to a normal distribution.
· Kurtosis is sometimes reported as “excess kurtosis.” Excess kurtosis is determined by subtracting 3 from the kurtosis. This makes the normal distribution kurtosis equal 0.

Skewness essentially measures the symmetry of the distribution, while kurtosis determines the heaviness of the distribution tails.
